# MUSICBOX
Collaborative playlists made simple. Join a room and start adding songs to the playlist. The master device (currently configured as a device with a minimum size of an iPad) will be responsible for playing the music video. Slave devices (phones) act as remote controls. Users that login can also upvote songs for it to play sooner. Persistence and real-time functions managed using Firebase. Built to be responsive.
